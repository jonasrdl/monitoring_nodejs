# monitoring_nodejs

I didnt want to configure icinga2 because it looked like shit, it was faster to just create my own monitoring service.

There are hosts and commands to configure, the hosts will use the commands to check your services.

# how to install

clone this repo: run ```git clone https://github.com/lucaspape/monitoring_nodejs.git```

run ```npm install```   

To generate configs you can use the setup.js   
run ```node setup.js```

# how to run

run ```npm start```  

# hosts

This script supports two different types of hosts: local and remote. Set ```remote``` in the host config to ```true``` to connect to it over SSH.   
If you set ```remote``` to ```true``` you must provide the following ```vars```: ```hostname```, ```username```, ```privateKeyPath```.   
```privateKeyPath``` must be a filepath and its public key must be added for the correct user on the remote server.   
Additionally you can provide the ```port``` variable if you are not using the standard port 22.

```
{
   "name":"lucaspape.de",
   "remote": true,
   "vars": {
     "hostname": "examplehost.com",
     "username": "monitoringuser",
     "privateKeyPath": "/private.key"
   }
   "notify": [
     {
       "how": "email",
       "vars": {
         "email": "admin@lucaspape.de"
       }
     },
     {
       "how": "influx"
     },
     {
       "how": "webhook",
       "vars": {
         "endpoint": "http://webhook.lucaspape.de/message"
       }
     }
   ],
   "check_commands":[
      {
         "command_name": "check_http",
         "unique_name": "check_http_lucaspape",
         "vars":{
            "web_url":"https://lucaspape.de"
         }
      },
      {
         "command_name":"check_alive_ip4",
         "vars":{
            "ip4":"1.1.1.1"
         }
      }
   ]
}
```

Every host must have a unique ```name```, a ```notify``` array and a ```check_commands``` array.  

The ```notify``` array contains methods on how to notify the user. Every object in the array must have a ```how``` (currently ```email```, ```influx``` or ```webhook```) and optionally an extra ```vars``` object.   
```email``` and ```webhook``` will be called only on errors and warnings whereas everything will be saved in ```influx```.   
A ```post``` request will be sent to the ```webhook``` ```endpoint``` including the message in the body.   

Warning: this project only works with influxdb version 1.8.9. Im not sure what the changes are with influx 2.0 and I dont care.   

The ```check_commands``` array contains the commands that will be run to check system health.  
Every command must have a ```command_name```, this must be the same as the command ```name``` declared in the command.  
Optionally it can have a ```vars``` object for variables.  
Optionally ```unique_name``` can be used, if missing it will be generated from the ```vars``` array or random. If you have passwords or other important information in ```vars``` you should specify ```unique_name``` because it is shown in notifications.  

# config

```reoccurring_error_message_time```: time between two error messages (that resulted from the same command) in minutes  
```reoccurring_warning_message_time```: time between two warning messages (that resulted from the same command) in minutes  
```check_time```: time between batch of commands in seconds  
```command_delay```: delay before running single command in seconds  
```command_timeout```: timeout of single command in seconds  
```validate_error```: retries if command returns error  
```mail``` mail configuration  
```ìnfluxdb``` influxdb configuration  

# commands
```
{
   "name":"check_http",
   "required_vars":[
      "hostname"
   ],
   "command":"curl $hostname --fail --silent --show-error"
}
```

Every command must have a unique ```name```, a ```required_vars``` array (can be empty) and the actual ```command```.  
You can specify vars in ```required_vars``` and then use these vars in ```command``` by using a ```$```.

##

__By default a command is considered failed if it outputs an error into stderr.__

You can change it like this:

```
{
   "name":"check_procs",
   "required_vars":[],
   "command":"ps -e | wc -l",
   "error_on": "out_larger_than_value",
   "error_value": 500
}
```

Now the command is considered failed when the output is larger than 500.  

Available ```error_on``` methods:

```out_larger_than_value```       output is larger than value  
```out_smaller_than_value```      output is smaller than value  
```value_exact_out```             output is exactly value  
```value_not_exact_out```         output is exactly not value  

You can do the same thing with warnings:

```
{
   "name":"check_updates_yay",
   "required_vars":[],
   "command":"yay -Qu | wc -l",
   "warning_on": "out_larger_than_value",
   "warning_value": 0
}
```

Available ```warning_on``` methods: same as ```error_on``` methods  

##

```
{
   "name":"check_diskspace_usage",
   "required_vars":[
     "disk"
   ],
   "command_base64":"ZGYgLWhsIHwgZ3JlcCAnJGRpc2snIHwgYXdrICd7c2l6ZSs9JDI7cGVyY2VudCs9JDU7fSBFTkR7cHJpbnQgcGVyY2VudH0n",
   "warning_on": "out_larger_than_value",
   "warning_value": 50
}
```

Instead of ```command``` you can write ```command_base64```, useful for complex commands that would result in JSON parse errors.
You can still use variables the same way.

##

```
{
   "name":"check_updates_yay",
   "required_vars":[],
   "command":"yay -Qu | wc -l",
   "warning_on": "out_larger_than_value",
   "warning_value": 0,
   "debug_command": "yay -Qu"
}
```

You can add a ```debug_command```, if an error occurs it will be run and the output included in the notification.  
You can use the same vars like in ```command``` specified in ```required_vars```.  
Instead of ```debug_command``` you can write ```debug_command_base64```.

- check if process is running command
- check if docker container is running
- check if sustained load, ignore random bursts for email
